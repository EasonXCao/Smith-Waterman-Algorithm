# Smith-Waterman-Algorithm
## Introduction
This algorithm aims at implementing Smith-Waterman algorithm in python. 
\
\
The HW1_SW_Algorithm folder contains:
* hw1.py: the main code file;
* blosum62.txt: the substitution matrix file for protein alignment;
* sample-input1.txt, sample-input2.txt: input files with two given sequences in each file;
* sample-output1.txt, sample-output2.txt: output files with score matrix and alignment result;
* input.txt: input file for testing.
\
\
To run the algorithm, type the following command:

  <code>
  ## Usage: python hw1.py -i &lt;input file&gt -s &lt;output file&gt 
  </code>
  <br>
  <code>
  ## Example: python hw1.py -i input.txt -s blosum62.txt
  </code>

The output is a .txt file with score matrix and alignment result.
